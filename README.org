Introduction to Deep Learning in R

By Toby Dylan Hocking.

** Installation instructions

[[https://cloud.r-project.org/banner.shtml][Download]] the most recent release of R (4.2.3).

Download an IDE that supports R. 
- If you already use emacs, try [[https://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics]], see [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwc48KSH3D1Onsed66FPLywMSIQmAhUYJ][my video
  screencasts which show how to install emacs and configure
  ESS]], or [[https://plantarum.ca/2020/12/30/emacs-tutorial-03/][this written tutorial]].
- Otherwise, a good IDE for beginners is [[https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/][RStudio]].

Then, run the following R code to install the required packages.

#+begin_src R
  install.packages(c("data.table", "R.utils", "ggplot2", "torch"))
  torch::torch_tensor(pi)
#+end_src

If torch has been installed properly, you should see the following output:

#+begin_src R
> torch::torch_tensor(pi)
torch_tensor
 3.1416
[ CPUFloatType{1} ]
#+end_src

** 19 April 2023 workshop

A 2 hour workshop for the [[https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/resbaz/Arizona2023/][ResBaz AZ (Research Bazaar Arizona) 2023]].

We will start by discussing concepts on
[[file:HOCKING-slides-short.pdf][Slides PDF]], [[file:HOCKING-slides-short.tex][LaTeX source]], adapted from [[https://github.com/tdhock/2020-yiqi-summer-school#prepared-for-the-summer-school-4th-year-2021][ML Intro from Land Carbon
Modeling Summer School]].

Afterward we will show a demo of R code: [[file:2023-04-19-deep-learning.Rmd][source]], [[https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/2023-res-baz-az/2023-04-19-deep-learning.html][rendered]].
